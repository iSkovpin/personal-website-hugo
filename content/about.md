* PHP
* Yii2

* and much more in bits

I have experience in

* developing a web application architecture from scratch

I worked both in custom and product software development, including remotely:

* 2018-2019 Laboratory 365

I like to write clean and supportable code, and feel no shame for its quality then :)

At this moment I live in Russia, Tomsk (UTC+7).

In my free time, I play the guitar and drink super strong puer tea.
