Hello! I'm Ivan, professional backend web developer.

I have about 5 years of experience in commercial software development.

My primary skills are:

* PHP
* Yii2
* MySQL

Also, I used

* JavaScript
* PostgreSQL 
* Docker
* ElasticSearch 
* Symfony 
* Go
* and much more in bits

I have experience in

* developing a web application architecture from scratch
* API development
* 3rd party services integration
* page loading speed optimization
* creating and containerizing microservices
* setting up an application's deploy to Kubernetes cluster

I worked both in custom and product software development, including remotely:

* 2019-2019 Telebreeze
* 2018-2019 Laboratory 365
* 2017-2018 upwrok.com (freelance)
* 2016-2017 Studio 15
* 2015-2015 Artline Group
* 2014-2015 OOO "AVVI"

I like to write clean and supportable code, and feel no shame for its quality then :)

At this moment I live in Russia, Tomsk (UTC+7).

In my free time, I play the guitar and drink super strong puer tea.
